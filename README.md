For mainMP.py a virtual environment is needed in order to run the mediapipe library (please note that it must use python3.8):

apt install python3.8 -venv

python3.8 -m venv myenv

source myenv/bin/activate

pip install mediapipe


If you need to activate the environment from other folders:

source ../myenv/bin/activate
